# NeuralNetwork
An approach to neural networks and genetic algorithms

## Lots of things to do
I'm following the idea represented in this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3tRFayqVtk&t=594s
many things will be different to simplify the project as I never touched nothing of the sort 

The things I'll be following will be the concept:
- Working on a grid as the environment
- The selecton will be done by portioning the grid
- etc...

What I will change will be the quantity of data I'm going to work whith
starting from the Input nodes of the neural network
